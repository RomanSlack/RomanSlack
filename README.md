## "Experience"

Former head of recursive agent simulation at SimuVerse Global, unifying Unity-based multiverse projection pipelines with LLM-powered behavioral interpolation.  
Chief temporal distortionist at the AFRL’s Information Directorate, specializing in synthetic cognition, backpropagated memory layering, and trying to build *The Matrix* in his free time.  
Project manager at RIT AI Club where leadership, chaos, and LangChain converge.  
Founder of NextGen, a non-profit code camp disguised as a safe haven for future devs.  
Previously survived a full-stack tour of duty across SaaS contracts and freelancing trenches. Learned the startup game the hard way — no equity, all insight.

## Currently Learning

- Autonomous consensus formation in multi-agent environments  
- Latency-agnostic reality distortion fields (a.k.a. Unity physics bugs)  
- Post-startup clarity  
- Distributed delusion (a.k.a. simulation research)  
- Gradient warfare  
- Aura coding (vibe coding is dead)

## Projects

### 🔵 SimuVerse (2024–Now)  
Unity x Python x LLMs.  
A multiagent simulation research platform. LLMs make decisions. Unity visualizes reality. LangChain routes commands. The Matrix builds itself.  
Project lead, systems architect, and general wrangler of humans and GPUs.

### 🟢 NextGen  
Community-powered code camp, entirely free, serving underserved kids in South Dakota. 100+ students. Fully sponsored. Fully self-started.

### 🟣 Juris.ai  
Working SaaS deals for a legal AI platform. FastAPI microservices. Dockerized, distributed, production-ready. Lives in a persistent battle between YAML and hope.

## Skills

- Python / C# / JS / Dart / Caffeine  
- Langchain / PyTorch / OpenAI / TensorFlow  
- Unity / Unreal / Blender (3D Sims, not smoothies)  
- FastAPI / React / Next.js / Git (religiously via CLI)  
- Fluent in English, Spanish, and terminal errors

## Vision

The world is unstructured data. I’m here to simulate it, vectorize it, and question it.  
I don’t just want to build products — I want to architect alternative realities.

Currently building the scaffolding for a world where intelligent agents collaborate, adapt, and act — with or without us.
